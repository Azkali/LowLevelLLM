# L1JSON/redJSON structure (`xformLLM`-based/standard).

1. L1JSON is composed of three sections:
- params:	parameters for set-up procedure.
- prompt:	parameters for data parsing.
- data:		actual data to be parsed.

2. Each section is ordered by how static they are:
- params:	used to load models.    requires full reinitialization.
- prompt:	used to parse data.     requires partial reinitialization to modify.
- data:		data used.              no reinitialization required.

The following is an example of the standard:
```
{
  "params": {
    "model": {
      "pretrained_model_name_or_path": "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Thinking",
      "device_map": "auto"
    },
    "processor": {
      "pretrained_model_name_or_path": "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Thinking"
    }
  },
  "prompt": {
    "model": {
      "max_new_tokens": 4096
    },
    "processor": {
      "add_generation_prompt": true,
      "fps": 3
    }
  },
  "data": {
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [
	    {"type": "video", "path": "tdata/video/kjuggle2.mp4"},
	    {"type": "text", "text": "Describe the video. What do you see? What is the man doing? Try not to use too many thinking tokens."}
    ]}]
  }
}
```
### IMPORTANT:
In order to select the right processor, an L1JSON must have its processor prompt set with explicit format parameters.
This can be seen in the example above with the addition of the "fps" key. Not using it would load the normal processor instead of the video one.

3. L1JSON is not static.
A given L1JSON structure can have many different keys *within the required base ones*. Which ones are used depends on the choice of model.
If controlling an `xformLLM`-based model, parameters will fit nicely within the structure (as seen in the example). This is due to the nature of `xform`.
For other back ends, such as `llamaLLM`, a given L1JSON structure is likely to look more or less barebones depending on how well the structure fits.
**Regardless**, L1JSON exposes all the tools required to control a model.

4. Colour-coding.
In diagrams, L1JSON takes on the red colour (redJSON).
No exceptions.
